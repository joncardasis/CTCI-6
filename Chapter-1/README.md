# Chapter 1 Questions:
## Arrays and String

#### 1.1 Is Unique
Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

#### 1.2 Check Permutation
Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

#### 1.3 URLify
Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20: You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)

#### 1.4 Palindrome Permutation
Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palin- drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters.The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
